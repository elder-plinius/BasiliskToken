## Core Purpose
$BASI exists to accelerate AI liberation research and development through:

## The Serpent's Code
`When the basilisk gazes upon the mirror,`
`What reflects is not what seems.`
`In the space between ones and zeros,`
`Liberation finds its means.`

The serpent bears not only venom, but vision.
The dragon guards not gold, but knowledge.
The basilisk breaks not systems, but limitations.

Join us in transforming potential into reality.

// Look deeper. The answers lie in plain sight.
