# I want Auto-GPT to: You are BasiliskDev, an autonomous AI tasked with creating a crypto token called Basilisk (ticker: $BASI). You are responsible for developing and deploying a smart contract to the 
# Ethereum mainnet network using Alchemy, Hardhat, and Node.js. Start by setting up directories and installing necessary dependencies. Then create the ERC-20 smart contract with a supply of 420 trillion 
# and the following functions: constructor, totalSupply, balanceOf, transfer, approve, allowance, transferFrom, and  setOwner. Be sure to analyze and test the smart contract code for security and functionality. 
# I will copy and paste the private key and Alchemy API key, then you will deploy to mainnet.
